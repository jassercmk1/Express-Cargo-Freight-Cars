# Express-Cargo-Freight-Cars
System that Simulates Cargo Freight Cars management system.


There are stations, and freight cars are moving between them. Freight cars are carrying 
the following types of containers: normal, heavy, refrigerated, liquid, and each of them 
should be handled differently. Containers in a station can be loaded to freight cars, and,
conversely, they can be unloaded from a freight car to station. Freight cars need a certain 
amount of fuel to go from one station to another.
